## Overview

reading book after book and stacking your book in to the shelf after you finish reading it but the best felling is when you see all the books you read those years in your shelf and and the space that take in your library. unfortunately this not the same for digital readers yes we track our reading but it’s not the same felling seeing that you read 10 books as number it’s not like seeing it in front of you. this why i made this website to bring this feeling the digital users.
